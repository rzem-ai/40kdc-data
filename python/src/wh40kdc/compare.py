"""Fleet comparison: expected kills of attacker units against target profiles.

A *cross product*. Given a set of attacker units (a whole faction, or an
explicit list), a set of :class:`~wh40kdc._types.TargetProfile` archetypes, a
distance, and a phase, this builds a matrix whose every cell is the expected
number of models the attacker kills in that target with its best-performing
weapon at that range.

Target profiles **reference real dataset units** (``faction_id`` + ``unit_id``)
rather than copying stat lines, so the cell math resolves the live unit and
feeds it straight to :func:`~wh40kdc.cruncher.crunch`. The target's defensive
abilities (Feel No Pain, ability-granted invulns, save/toughness mods) are
resolved via :meth:`Dataset.defensive_buffs_for` and stacked onto the crunch —
the same path the salvo example app uses for dataset targets.

Rapid Fire / Melta come for free: the engine reads ``withinHalfRange`` out of
the context, so each cell passes ``distance <= range / 2``.

Run as ``python -m wh40kdc.compare --attacker-faction world-eaters --range 15``.
The numbers reported are **per model firing one instance of the weapon**
(``models_firing`` defaults to 1) — exact for single-model units like the
Forgefiend, and a per-weapon-per-model figure for squads.
