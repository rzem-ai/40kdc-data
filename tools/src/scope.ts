/**
 * Resolve which roster units an ability (typically a detachment rule) benefits,
 * from its curated `applies_to` keyword filter. This is the roster-highlighting
 * contract consumers replicate: a unit matches iff it carries every
 * `required_keywords` entry and none of the `excluded_keywords`, compared
 * against the union of its `keywords` and `faction_keywords`. Matching is
 * exact-string and case-sensitive — keywords are authored in datasheet Title
 * Case on both sides.
 *
 * Two distinct "no constraint" forms, both deliberate:
 *   - a `null`/absent filter has no resolvable scope → matches nothing (the app
 *     renders no highlight rather than guess);
 *   - a present filter object with neither keyword list constrains nothing →
 *     matches every unit (vacuous required/excluded sets).
 *
 * Pinned byte-for-byte across the TS/Rust/Python ports by the
 * `conformance/applies-to` corpus (bump `conformance/SPEC_VERSION` on change).
